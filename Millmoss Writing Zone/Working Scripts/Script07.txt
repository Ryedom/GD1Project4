"General Camilla":"Oh my god."
"General Rowan":"More lies from the negotiator I see."
"General Camilla":"You're insane. You really plan to use anti-matter weaponry on us."
"General Rowan":"Even if, theoretically, I was planning to strike Ranval. Do you really think I would do it with illegal weaponry?"
"General Camilla":"I very much do."
"General Rowan":"So what, you've been spooked by some nonsense and you're not gonna occupy Ranval now?"
"General Camilla":"I can't believe you would stoop so low General Rowan. To think that your people actually respect you."
"General Camilla":"In light of this, I think we may have to restrategize."

"General Rowan":"That's not gonna change a thing and you know that."
"General Camilla":"Do you have any idea how much blood you would have on your hands?"
"General Camilla":"Do you even care?"
"General Rowan":"Surprising words to hear coming from a person who's killed so many."
"General Rowan":"And quite frankly, I don't care how many of your people I have to kill to stop you from taking our territory."
"General Camilla":"So you admit that the evidence presented here is the truth?"
"General Rowan":"I admit nothing, but if I did have such weaponry as I this negotiator claims I have, I would use it to full effect without a doubt."
"General Camilla":"You're a monster."
"General Rowan":"Perhaps. But you're as much as monster as I."
"General Rowan":"I would be killing a fraction of those that you've killed in all your years of conquering systems."
"General Rowan":"If anything it would be justice."
"General Camilla":"Conversation with this maniac is going to go not further."
"General Camilla":"I want out of this room. Now."
"Black Screen":"General Camilla took her aides and guards with her out into the storm to get away from General Rowan."
"Black Screen":"Several of her subordinates died as a result, but no more argument between her and General Rowan was going to occur."
