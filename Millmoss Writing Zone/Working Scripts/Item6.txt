Year 3810, 3841, 3857 (61, 31, and 15 years ago) - Summary of UIN Reports on The Suverilan Republic

"The Suverilan Republic's government and military have historically been shown to be aggressive in diplomacy and war. It is consistently difficult to 'win' any confrontation with them as they are unyeilding in these areas and never go so far outside of United Intragalactic Nations law that intervention is deemed necessary by the UIN committee of that period."
