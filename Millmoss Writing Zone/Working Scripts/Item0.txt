Year 3835 (37 years ago) - The Red Empire: Is it really so great?

"The Red Empire is often cited as an example of the great things a lack of governmental restrictions can lead to. However, if you really look at it, things aren't as good as they seem. [...] systems often cited as being so prosperous are notably port systems. Other systems within The Red Empire paint a very different picture. Soutan for example is very close to a third-world system despite it being a short few light years away from Yalmit, The Red Empire's most prosperous system."
